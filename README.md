  <summary><b>Chip Floorplanning considerations</b></summary>
  <h3>Floorplanning</h3>
  <p>Floorplanning is a crucial early-stage step in the physical design process, where the initial layout of the chip is defined. It involves making high-level decisions about how various components will be arranged on the silicon substrate.</p>
  <h3>Core Area Definition:</h3>
  <p>Determine the overall dimensions of the chip and define the core area where the primary functional blocks and standard cells will be placed. This core area is surrounded by peripheral regions that may contain I/O pads and other necessary structures.</p>
  <h4>Utilization Factor</h4>
  <p>The Utilization Factor is calculated as the area occupied by the netlist divided by the total core area. A Utilization Factor of 1 indicates full utilization with no extra space, but in practice, it's typically around 0.5-0.6.</p>
  
```
  Utilization factor = Area occupied by Netlist/Total core Area
```

  <h4>Aspect ratio</h4>
  <p>The Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the chip's height to its width. A value of 1 signifies a square chip, while other values represent a rectangular shape.</p>
  
```
Aspect ratio = Chip Height/Chip Width
```
